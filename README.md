The program prompts the user to input. This is either an int or hexadecimal. Two functions: one for int type – intfunction () and the other for hex values - hexfunction (), help compute the calculations involved. For an int type input, the user should reply with 1, while for a hex input, the user will enter 2. After the user enters the number (int type), the program iterates through all digits of the number adding them together then prints the total (sum) result. E.g. say the user entered 1234: 
The program’s computation will be as follows:
1+2+3+4 = 10
The final answer will be 10. 


For hexadecimal input, the program takes a raw input of hex value then converts it to type int. It then computes the sum of the resulting int to get the total. Finally the program converts the resultant int sum into a hexadecimal. E.g. say the user entered 2F:
The program’s computation will be as follows:
Converts 2F to int hence, 47
Then, 4+7 = 11
Then converts 11 to hex.
